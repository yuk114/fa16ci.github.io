					<h3 style="font-family:Futura">An Interview With Me!</h3>

						<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Where are you from, how old are you, and what are you studying here at Parsons and where do you hope it will take you?</p>
						<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I am from a city in Los Angeles named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance,_California">Torrance</a>.
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Torranceca.jpg/2560px-Torranceca.jpg"/>
						<p style="font-family:Futura"
						>I'm 19 years old and I'm studying Communication Design. I'm interested in becoming a creative director or fashion editor and/or stylist. I want to work for a fashion publication in that capacity.</p>

						<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Why Parsons?</p>
						<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I decided to attend Parsons over any other school because Parsons carries a certain reputation. To attend this school means you have to be good at what you do and you have to be the best at what you do. Why not grow and expand as an artist at one of the best, if not the best, art schools in the world?</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: What are some of you interests?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I would say my main interest is Fashion. But beyond that I'm also interested set and production design, roller coaster engineering and design, film, art, the government and conspiracy theories and things of this nature.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: What about fashion interests me?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: Fashion isn't always regarded as an art form but I think it is. Fashion is art and art is something I'm interested in. Art is expression and I think through that brilliant works of art are created. Works of fantasy, curiosity, and desire. Fashion isn't just about what you clothes you decide to put on your body but it is a way of life. The way fashion interests me is it is a means of self expression, artistic expression, and aesthetics. From an early age is was always important for me to look my best and get 'dressed up'. I think as I've grown up clothing for me became sort of like a uniform and armor. I'm just going on and on but case in point, what interests me about fashion is how fashion and clothing can make you feel and that is what it's all about for me is a feeling, a mood, a vision, a direstion. I think that's why I'm interested in styling and creative direction because when I can see and feel clothes I can instantly imagine what to wear this with or what will go with that and what can create a beautiful outfit or image. Another interesting aspect of fashion is the idea of fast fashion and how rapidly this multi-billion dollar industry has grown and become accesible to so many people. Also racism in the industry.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Favorite designers and/or brands?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I like to think about this question in as if someone is asking me what designers and brands I could wear for the rest of my life and those would be Phoebe Philo for Celine, Vetments, Balenciaga, Raf Simons for Dior and Kris Van Assche for Dior Homme, Hedi Slimane for Saint Laurent, Azzedine Alaia, Frida Giannini for Gucci and Alessandro Michele for Gucci, Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, Acne Studios, Giorgio Armani Prive, Rodarte, early 2000's Roberto Cavalli, Peter Dundas for Pucci and Roberto Cavalli, Versace and last but not least Alexander Mcqueen. </p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Expanding on your interests, why are you interested in set and production design, roller coaster engineering and design, film, art, the government and conspiracy theories?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I've always been interested in what goes into fashion show like the runway or set/production design of the show. For example Karl Lagerfeld has always created these amazing, huge, sets for his Chanel's show. For exmaple the Fall Winter 2010-2011 RTW<a href="http://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/vjU7bV-W_LhiqTEOzpnrCn2gnTE/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2010/03/10/2/166/1668379/97578380_10/i/Chanel-Fall-2010-All-Faux-Fur-Icebergs.jpg'show"> show</a>. He had a real iceberg sit in the middle of the runway, in the middle of the Grand Palais. There's also the <a href="http://www.modernwearing.com/wp-content/uploads/Chanel-fall-winter-2012-2011-haute-couture.jpg">Golden Lion</a> and the Spring Summer 2011 <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_X6bxd1Nekg0/TKwr9Hi9EiI/AAAAAAAAA2c/sQGSQqytZD8/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-10-06+at+9.53.48+AM.png">show</a> in which Lagerfeld covered the entire floor space of the Grand Palais for the runway. One should really look at each Chanel show and the sets that are built because they are just spectacular and a spectacle. But to continue, I've always loved sketching out my ideas for a runway and in what direction models would walk in. I love Rodarte's runway designs as well as Raf Simons' runways design for Dior.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Roller coasters?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: Ah yes. Growing up I had this computer game or program called Roller Coaster Tycoon versions one, two, and three 'platinum edition'. This computer game let you build your own theme park. You could design your own roller coasters and that was the part of the game I loved the most however these games are from the early 2000s and they were pretty simple so the roller coasters couldn't do a lot of the fancier inversions that actualy roller coasters could do. You could make loops and corkscrews but nothing like immelmans and zero-g rolls. In addition, I've always loved going to amusement parks. Growing up in Southern California you have access to some of the best amusement parks, more specifically Disneyland Resort and Six Flag Magic Mountain. The first roller coaster I went on was Big Thunder Mountain at Disneyland and since then I've been hooked. I love the feeling of anitcipation and anxiousness you get as you're ascending the lift hill and that moment where your heart leaps out of your chest and your stomach goes to your chest or when it drops. I love that exhilaration. After visiting these amusment parks I really started to research roller coasters and examine the designs of a lot of them and through that I've always dreamed of designing my own. I would want to design a record breaking roller coaster. Some of my favorite ones are

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Do you want to discuss my interests in the government and conspiracy theories?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I would love to but I could go on for days about it. Let me just say I'm fascinated by government agencies like the CIA and the NSA. I love movies like Salt and Jason Bourne that of course are fictional but you never really know. These things, like spies and higly skilled, government trained assasins could exitst. Like in the ABC show Scandal, theres this secret agency called B613. It is a super-secret spy agency that operates outside the bounds of the federal government, using its assets to 'protect the Republic'. Like that just blows my mind because you never know if it could be real or not. Ok, maybe not the one from Scandal but one like it could exists. As far as conspiracy theories go, just go on youtube and search that term. I've watched hours and hours of them. I love the mystery behind Area 51, which I know exists for sure but don't ask me how I know. But let's cut this short because I could go on and on. But let me just say one of my favorite conspiracy theories is that the US government puts flouride in our water to control our minds.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Now for some fun questions. What is your dream job?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: My dream job would be editor-in-chief, creative director, art director of i-D Magazine and American Vogue.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q:Favorite musical artists?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: Beyonce for sure. I really love this Australian producer and musician Flume. Every song of his I fall in love with, I would marry him. I also love Rihanna. I love her music as well as her personal style. I wouldn't want to be Rihanna because that's Rihanna but I want to be just like her. Oh, and Daft Punk. They create <strong><em>MUSIC</em></strong></p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Where do you want to travel to?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: I really want to go to Paris. Cliche I know but it's Paris. I also want to go to China. Both of my grandparents are from China. My yeh-yeh, that's Chinese for your paternal grandfather, still remembers where his home is in Beijing. But I would love to go to see where my family started. This past July I went on cruise to Honduras and Belize and I'd love to go there again. The snorkeling was amazing and I love that small island way of life because it is so different from living in the US especially coming from Los Angeles and living in New York City. Next July I'm going on another Carribean cruise so it'll be another adventure. I also want to go to Vegas. I love it there. I love the idea of the old Vegas. Showgirls, neon lights, cigarettes, Sin City! I love Las Vegas and its nightlife. There's something so dreamy and nostalgic about it.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Describe your perfect day.</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: Being with my bestfriends and my boyfriend, driving around in my car, nothing but my favorite music deafening my ears while being really high, like out of my mind. Is that innapropriate?. I have this idyllic scene in my head where me and my best friends Pam and Maddie and by boyfriend Matt and I are in a old convertible car driving down an empty desert road while Ride by Lana Del Rey plays in the background. I'm in the passenger seat staring out itnto the desert admiring its beauty. I should be a music video director.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: If you could have three wishes what would the be and why?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: The first wish would be for infinite wishes because then I never will run out of wishes. The second would the end of racism and cultural appropriation. There are too many people dying and too many people getting away with stealing the cultures of those who are suffering. The third would be that I get my dream jobs.</p>

				<p style="font-family:Futura">Q: Some of your favorite quotes?</p>
				<p style="font-family:Futura">A: "If you don't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? - RuPaul. Another would just be the standard one like "Never give up", "Be the best person you can be", and it's so stupidly cliche but I live by "Live. Laugh. Love."</p>
