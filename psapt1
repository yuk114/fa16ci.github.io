There are different examples of racism in fashion and different examples of what represetation means. The racist aspects in fashion range from the clothes to the models and can be categorized into two main parts: culutural appropriation and the lack of use of models of color. This also leads to the issue of representation in fashion. The respresentation aspects in fashion range from body type to the use of models of color that represent a particular culture. The only way to fix these issues are to address them and figure out how we can make the industry change. Below you will find a series of links which give more information on each subject as well as information on how these important issues can be fixed</p>
