There are different examples of racism in fashion and different examples of what represetation means. The racist aspects in fashion range from the clothes to the models and can be categorized into two main parts: culutural appropriation and the lack of use of models of color. This also leads to the issue of representation in fashion. The respresentation aspects in fashion range from body type to the use of models of color that represent a particular culture. The only way to fix these issues are to address them and figure out how we can make the industry change. Below you will find a list of topics that dive deeper into Race &amp; Representation in Fashion</p>

				<p style="font-family: Muli; font-size:30px; color: white; text-align: center; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px">Cultural appropriation has long existed in fashion. Until recently, this issue was never brought to light. For example, when John Galliano presented his Christian Dior Haute Couture S/S 2007 collection which featured white models in 'geisha' like makeup no one made a fuss about it. If that collection were to be presented today, it would be cultural approprition. </p>
